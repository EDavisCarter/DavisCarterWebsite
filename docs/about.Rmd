###**Early Life** 

I grew up in Charlotte, NC ,aka The Queen City. Some of my earliest childhood memories are catching salamanders in the creek behind my Grandparent's house. As I grew older the creek, which once was seemingly filled with salamanders, crayfish and fish became polluted to the point I was warned not to even get in the water. This personal experience really brought home to me that humans can have extremely negative impacts on the environment even in a relatively short time period.
