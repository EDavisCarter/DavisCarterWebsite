**Research Experience** 

**Graduate Research Assistant, University of Tennessee, Knoxville**           Fall 2016-Present

Performed laboratory experiments and field studies on the emerging amphibian pathogens: ranavirus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) in the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture (UTIA) Center for Wildlife Health (advisors, Drs. Matthew Gray and Debra Miller)

**MS THESIS RESEARCH:** 

Goal: Identify reservoirs and factors responsible for reoccurring outbreaks of ranavirus in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.

•	Led all field operations, interacted with National Park Service personnel, and supervised >20 volunteers and technicians.

•	Installed and operated a pitfall and drift fence system around two ephemeral wetlands for capturing terrestrial amphibians.

•	Performed weekly sampling of terrestrial and larval amphibians (aquatic nets) during the breeding season for two consecutive years.

•	Marked captured amphibians with a unique ID and collected tissue samples for ranavirus DNA testing via quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR).

•	Organized, entered, and analyzed data using Excel® and the SAS® system.

•	Presented results to funding agencies in quarterly progress reports, presentations, and a thesis.

**ADDITIONAL COLLABORATIVE WILDLIFE DISEASE RESEARCH IN THE UTIA CENTER FOR WILDLIFE HEALTH:** 

•	Led controlled Bsal experiments for >25 North American amphibian species using a dose-dependent design (n = 5 – 10 animals per dose for 4 zoospore doses).

•	Maintained Bsal and ranavirus cultures, and performed experimental inoculations.

•	Monitored animals daily for signs of disease, performed euthanasia at humane endpoints, and collected tissues for pathogen testing.

•	Performed DNA extractions and qPCR (ranavirus, Bd, and Bsal) on >3000 swab and tissue samples. 

•	Trained new lab personnel in Biosafety Level 2 (BSL 2) and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) protocols.

•	Independently developed a method for quantifying and determining viability of Bsal zoospores using flow cytometry.

•	Independently evaluated new methods of differentiating encysted and motile Bsal zoospores.

**Graduate Teaching Assistant, University of Tennessee, Knoxville**          Fall 2016- Present 

Assisted instructors (Chris Graves and Dr. Matthew Gray) with undergraduate classes.

•	Graded tests, quizzes and other classroom assignments.

•	Supervised students during examinations.

•	Organized and assisted with field activities.

Courses: Dendrology (FWF 212), Conservation (FWF 250), Wildlife Habitat Evaluation (WFS 324), Wetlands Ecology and Management (WFS 340), and Wildlife Damage Management (WFS 350). 

**Research Associate I, University of Tennessee, Knoxville **            Summer 2015- Fall 2016                          
Organized and led several experiments involving the amphibian pathogens, ranavirus and Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd); supervisors = Drs. Matthew Gray and Debra Miller.

•	Cultured pathogens and led animal inoculations. 

•	Maintained experiments with large sample sizes involving up to 600 amphibians. Daily health monitoring, biosecurity precautions to limit cross-contamination, water changes, decontamination, humane euthanasia, necropsy, tissue collection and preservation. 

•	Led DNA extractions and tested samples for ranavirus and Bd using qPCR. 

**Senior Departmental Honors Research, Hampden-Sydney College**       Fall 2014 – Spring 2015                                                              
Continuation of research associated with experiment in summer 2014 

•	Tested presence/absence of ranavirus DNA in tissues using qPCR. 

•	Created and interpreted histology slides from preserved turtle tissues.

•	Analyzed experimental data and communicated results in a written report.


**Summer Research Assistant, Hampden-Sydney College**  		                           	Summer 2014                                                                
Performed experiment with Red-eared Sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans) measuring the interaction of ranavirus and herbicide exposures

•	Fed and monitored 160 juvenile turtles for 5 weeks. Weighed, measured, and assessed condition of turtles weekly.  Euthanized and necropsied turtles, and collected tissues. 

•	Extracted DNA from tissue samples collected from turtles during the experiment.

•	Tested presence/absence of ranavirus DNA in tissues using qPCR.

**Independent Study in Biology, Hampden-Sydney College**                Fall 2013 - Spring 2014
Continuation of research associated with survey study in summer 2013 

•	Extracted DNA from tissues obtained from several snake, lizard and turtle species.

•	Analyzed DNA quantities using a spectrophotometer.  

•	Performed PCR and Gel-Electrophoresis to determine the prevalence of ranavirus in reptiles in campus wetlands.

**Introductory Biology Lab Assistant, Hampden-Sydney College**  		 Spring 2014                                                                
•	Taught introductory students various laboratory techniques.

•	Assisted instructor by answering student questions and guiding them through labs.

**Summer Research Assistant, Hampden-Sydney College**  			Summer 2013
